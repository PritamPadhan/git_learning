Learning git from scratch
<br>
In this repository i will keep all my learning about Git and Github.
<br>
I started with watching "apna college/git and github for beginers".
<br>
To initialize a local repo as git repo, we have to run the command: git init
<br>
To clone the remote repo, where we want to do the modifications, we run the command: git clone <remote repo link>
<br>
To stage all untracked files(newly added files) and modified files, we run the command: git add .
<br>
To commit all the changes, we run command: git commit -m "message"
<br>
To do the final push into the remote repo, use command: git push origin main
<br>
Before push, you have to do the following set up, it's one time set up.
<br>
git config --global user.name "user github account name"
<br>
git config --global user.email "user github account password"
